# mini python project
# fake-news-headline-generator
A fun and beginner-friendly Python project that generates random, humorous fake news headlines using combinations of celebrities, outrageous actions, and bizarre locations or items.

# Project Overview
This project randomly generates fake news-style headlines by selecting phrases from three different lists:
Subjects (e.g., "Elon Musk", "Shah Rukh Khan")
Actions (e.g., "is moving to Mars", "is writing a new book")
Places or Things (e.g., "on a spaceship", "in the metaverse")
Every time the script runs, a unique and funny headline is generated. The user is then prompted to either generate another headline or exit the program.

# Key Features
Randomly generates unique fake news headlines.
Interactive command-line input for continuous headline generation.
Uses Python's built-in random module.
Simple and readable code structure â€” great for learning and practicing:
Loops
List operations
User input
String formatting

# How It Works
The program defines three lists: subjects, actions, and places_or_things.
Inside an infinite loop:
One random element is selected from each list.
These are combined into a formatted string to create a fake news headline.
The headline is printed in the console.
The user is asked if they want to generate another headline.
If the user says "no", the program exits with a thank-you message.
